## Purpose

The point of this Calculator program is to provide a quick and easy way for users to do calculations.

It has multiple operators to choose from. These include:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Divsion
* Power
* Square Root
* Log Base 10
* Random Number Generator

## Function

This project works by taking inputs from the user and passing them as parameters through different functions. 

1. The user will click on buttons, assigning those number values as their inputs.
2. When the operator button is pressed, those parameters are sent through the corresponding function.
3. At the end, the operation result is displayed to the user.

## To Add

Through future development I intend on adding more operators. These include but are not limited to:
* Radicals
* Irrational Numbers
* Stored Previous Answers
